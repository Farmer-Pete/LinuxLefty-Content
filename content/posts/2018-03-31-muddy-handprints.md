## Painting Daddy's Truck

The other day one the kids were playing outside in the mud. When they came back in and we asked if they had fun, they happily exclaimed:

> Yes! We painted Daddy's truck!

I went outside and they had used mud to finger paint all over the truck.

I think it is fantastic. I bet I'm the only one at Oracle that rolls up with muddy hand prints :)
