We are blessed to have such good friends and family. A couple weeks ago, my parents came to help us with our [home's exterior](/posts/exterior-improvements-thanks-dad-mom). This week Mr. and Mrs. Parker drove down from New York to help out with some interior projects around the home.

They painted our son's room and installed some new baseboards. Thank you so much!
