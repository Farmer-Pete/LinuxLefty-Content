I've been working on a pop door for the chicken coop. There is a main door that I use to enter and exit the coop. However, there is a small opening in the side that would allow the chickens to enter and exit the coop at will. However, I wanted a small door that allow me to shut the chickens in at night, and keep predators out. While there are many commercially available doors, I decided to make my own.

I purchased a thick piece of sheet metal to use as a door.

Then, I drilled holes and bolted on reinforcements, hinges, and a latch.

The only problem is that once I installed the door, even with the reinforcements, a determined predator would still be able to bend the door and get in. I'll have to redesign the door, but in the mean time, I just installed the door upside down in a way that it cannot be opened. The chickens can just use the big human door for now.
