On most mornings, I lead a meeting which I call "The Daily Sync", a time for the various different groups (both US and India) to come together, resolve problems, and exchange information. I like to start this time out with a quote. I feel that it sets the mood and often frames the problems of the day in a helpful way.

This morning's quote was from Voltaire, and it especially stood out to me:

> Each player must accept the cards life deals him or her: but once they are in hand, he or she alone must decide how to play the cards in order to win the game.

This makes me think of countless lessons my Dad has taught me over the years. Growing up, he has emphasized the importance of persistence and overcoming adversity.

In addition, the quote highlights the tension between accepting limitations and not letting those limitations define us.

I'd love to hear your thoughts!
