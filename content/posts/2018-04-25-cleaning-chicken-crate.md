Today the crate that the chicks live in was getting really smelly and downright disgusting.

So, I shoveled out all the old bedding

And I put down all fresh bedding.

Now it's ready for them to lay down a fresh layer of poo, lol. I can't wait for the chicken coop to be finished so we can get them out of the house!
