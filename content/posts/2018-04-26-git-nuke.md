Git is pretty good at branching and keeping everything neat and tidy. However, occasionally our branches get really messed up, and I have to clean things up. Here are a couple commands that I've found useful for this task.

### Deleting Untracked Files

```bash
git clean -f -d
```

### Abort a merge

```bash
git reset --merge
```

### Revert changes

```bash
git reset --hard <COMMIT>
```

Note that you can always use the commit hash, but if you want to go back "N" commits, you can use the commit ID of "HEAD~N". Notice this is a tidle, not a dash.

### Throw away all local changes

```bash
git reset --hard origin/<BRANCH>
```
