Today my wife and I took a quick trip down to Charlottesville, VA to celebrate our anniversary. We visited {{<a "Sunrise Farm" "http://sunrisefarm.net/">}} and got 200 lbs of chicken feed for our rapidly growing chicks. We also stopped by {{<a "Ace Biscuits & Barbecue" "https://www.facebook.com/AceBiscuitBbq">}} for lunch. I got their Cuban sandwich and my wife got the ribs. The food was excellent! Plus, we got a couple hours in the car to talk without interruptions (it's the small things in life, lol)

It was a fun, simple day :).
