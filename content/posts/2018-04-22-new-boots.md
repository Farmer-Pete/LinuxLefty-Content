I finally bought some cowboy boots and I have been really enjoying them. After week of projects including getting feed, cleaning out the [chicken coop](/tags/coop), digging trenches, and chasing kids, I washed up the boots and I'm ready to head back to the office tomorrow. That's exactly what I wanted from a boot.

Anyone in the area should definitely check out the place where I bought my boots: {{<a "Bonnie Reb Boot Shop" "http://bonniereb.com/">}} in Culpeper.
