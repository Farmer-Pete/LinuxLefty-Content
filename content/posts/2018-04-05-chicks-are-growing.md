The chicks are finally old enough to remove the paper towels and put down the bedding. It has been fun to see them starting to scratch, throwing the shavings everywhere. I raised their water up a bit to keep the savings out. I still have to muck the cage a couple times a week, but it beats having to change the paper towels a couple times a day!

They are not even a week old and they are already significantly lager than when they came. I think we might need to get a larger cage before they are old enough to be moved to the hen house.
