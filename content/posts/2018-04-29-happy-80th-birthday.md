Today we celebrated my grandparent's **80th** birthday!

It was really good to see them again (they flew back from Taiwan), and it was cool to see old photos of them, and hear stories of their past.

My mom also prepared a slide show to honor them, and the kids and I sang "Jesus Loves Me" in Chinese.

It was a wonderful celebration :)
