Today my wife and I scrubbed the chicken coop. [Yesterday](/posts/chicken-coop-defunkification-2) I scrapped away the broken drywall and wasp nests with a crowbar. Today, we took buckets of water and scrubbed away all the dirt, grime, and nest remnants.

While I wouldn't want to eat off of the surfaces, it's starting to look good :)
