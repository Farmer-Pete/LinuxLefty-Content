I continued replacing the coop windows. I built a wooden frame around each window and then joined the two frames together.

Then I installed the windows, framing the space around the windows as these are smaller than the ones they are replacing.

Things were really starting to come together, but the project started to derail when I installed the plywood. I didn't purchase sheets wide enough, so I had to cut and install two smaller pieces. I must of measured incorrectly, because I had a couple inch gap in the middle. I cut another piece to cover the gap, but now it looks kind of funky. I'm not too concerned about it, though, because I have plans which will cover this space up.

The great news is that with the windows complete, I can finally move the chickens out of our house and into their new home!
