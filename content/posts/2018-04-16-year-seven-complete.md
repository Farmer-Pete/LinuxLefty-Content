Tomorrow my wife and I will be celebrating our eighth wedding anniversary. We heard from several sources that the seventh year {{<a "is the hardest" "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_seven-year_itch">}}, and indeed it was tough. We had our third child, and this was the toughest pregnancy and delivery so far. Plus, the transition from two to three was really tough on my wife. On top of that, we bought a new house and then had my in-laws move in with us. There were some strenuous times, but in the end, my wife is still my best friend :). There is no one else I would rather spend my day with, no one I'd rather have by my side through thick and thin.

Thanks so much for sticking with me, my love. Here's to another seven years :) !
