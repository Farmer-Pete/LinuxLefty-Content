I read this quote this morning, and is has stuck with me throughout the day:

> The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man. -- George Bernard Shaw

This past weekend, my wife and I were dreaming and planning on what new projects we are going to tackle. We kept asking ourselves, "are we crazy?" for even thinking of attempting such things when we are already busy with kids and life? The answer is "yes", but that's okay. I'm okay with being unreasonable and attempting crazy things. Because that is how I want to live my life. I don't want to look back on a life time of safe choices. I want to live and forge ahead and be an unreasonable man (in a good way).
