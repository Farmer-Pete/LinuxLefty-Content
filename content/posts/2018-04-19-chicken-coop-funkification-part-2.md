To celebrate our [anniversary](/tags/anniversary), I'm taking the week off as a farm-cation (a mini vacation where you work on the farm).

For the rest of the week, and next week if I have any time after work, I'm working on fixing up the chicken coop so that we can move the chicks out there. The coop has fallen in disrepair and needs some TLC before we can put our chicks in there.

In general the coop was a bit scary, not at all the cozy home we wanted to provide for the chicks.

My wife and I were discussing how clean we should get the coop before we can move the chicks, I told her:

> Right now the coop is funky. My goal is to get it to the place where it is just merely dirty

So, I suited up for battle.

After sweeping out all the old wood shavings and poo, the coop immediately looked better.

Then, I used a crowbar to pull out all the leftover bits of drywall and scrape off all the abandoned wasp nests.

Tomorrow I'm going to get a scrub brush and bucket to clean up the wood even more.
