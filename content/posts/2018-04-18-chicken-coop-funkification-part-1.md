The chickens are getting bigger and are rapidly outgrowing their current home (a large dog crate). Plus, they are really messy. Everything nearby is covered in a thin layer of dust, and poo is everywhere.

The thing is that the chicks are still really little and I'm worried about raccoons. I designed a fence that would totally encase the chicken coop from predators. I showed the design to wife and she described it as "all out warfare".

We instead came up with a sensible plan to clean our existing coop and secure it properly. I'm so glad that I have her :)
