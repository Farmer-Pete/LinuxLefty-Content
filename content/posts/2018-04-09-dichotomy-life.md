The other day I was in my {{<tag truck truck>}}, driving to the farm store to get supplies for the {{<tag chicks chicks>}}, listening to some {{<tag "dubstep music" music>}}. I was suddenly struck by the dichotomy of my life. I currently the [technical lead at Oracle](/resume), yet I live on a farm where I split my own wood and raise my own chickens. I am a dedicated, soft-spoken {{<tag "Christian" faith>}}, but I think going to MMA class where I come home with bruises and a bloody nose is fun. I am considered by my friends to be rock-solid and stable, but I've also submitted myself for a psychiatric evaluation when I was convinced that I was going crazy.

My life is a big mash-up of things that don't seem to go together. Is this strange, or is this just the way life is? Let know your thoughts :)
