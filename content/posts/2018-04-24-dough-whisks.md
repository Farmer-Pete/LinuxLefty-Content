Many years ago I bought my wife a set of {{<a "dough wisks" "https://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/dough-whisk-set">}} from King Author Flour. Just the other day she was using them, commenting how good they are. They have held up well and we use them to mix everything from thin pancake batter to thick bread dough. It does a great job of mixing things like a whisk, but it is super easy to clean and doesn't get gummed up. They're awesome! :)
