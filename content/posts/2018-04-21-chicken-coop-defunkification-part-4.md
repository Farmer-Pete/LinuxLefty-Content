Today I worked (you guessed it) out in the chicken coop. Now that the walls are clean, I wanted to stain and waterproof the inside. Hopefully this will help protect the wood from everything the chicks throw at it, and will deter any future wasps from taking up residence inside the coop. I was only able to complete about half the job before I ran out of stain, but here's what I was able to get done:

Compare that against what we started with:

I still have to finish the staining, but I think it is safe to declare the coop "defunkified"!
