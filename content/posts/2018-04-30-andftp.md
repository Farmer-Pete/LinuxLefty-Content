When I am writing blog posts, I need a simple way to quickly send selected photos from my phone to my laptop. [AndFTP](http://www.lysesoft.com/products/andftp/) is a simple utility that fits the bill. While it can do many advanced things such folder synchronization, my favorite feature is its "share" capabilities. After AndFTP is proper configured, I simply find the photo I want on my phone, share it with AndFTP and it automagically appears on my laptop. Easy peasy!
