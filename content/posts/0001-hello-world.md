## In the beginning

Over the years, LinuxLefty has taken various different forms. I started out using [MODX](http://modx.com/), then used [WordPress](http://wordpress.org), then I ported the site over to [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/), then I decided I wanted to write articles and used [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki), then I gave up completely and let the site lapse. Now I'm rebooting the site with the help of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

## A place to call my own

I first created the site when I was entering college. Now, I'm married with three young kids. I care less about things like SEO (search engine optimization) and social media sharing. I now just want a corner of the web that I can call my own. I want a digital diary of sorts where I can keep in touch with friends and family, documenting my journey through life.

Hopefully you find something of use :)
