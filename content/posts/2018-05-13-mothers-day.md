Today was Mother's day. The other day I came home from Costco with 10lbs of ribs. I handed them to my wife and told her "I'd thought you would like these better than roses". She laughed and cradled them for a bit in her arms like they were a box of long stems.

I started prepping the ribs at 9am and smoked them low and slow all day. Finally, around 5pm we sat down to dinner. They were really delicious! This was the first time I had smoked anything on the charcoal grill. Next time, I'll start them even earlier, as I would prefer them a bit more tender, but my wife was really happy with the meal and that's all that matters :).
