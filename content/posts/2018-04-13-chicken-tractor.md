The chicks [keep getting bigger](/posts/chicks-are-growing-fast) and the dog crate they are in is getting a little tight. We eventually need to figure out a new temporary home for them, before they are big enough to live in the chicken coop. However, in the mean time, I built a chicken tractor so that they can have some outside time. It is a much larger area for them to run around in and they are able to free range for part of the day.

It was crafted from various random materials that the previous home owner left behind: a shelving unit, plastic lattice, and a few small wood posts. With a bit of ingenuity and a whole lot of zip-ties, I was able to craft the chick's outside home. I was even able to make a hatch for easy interior access.

The hardest part was getting the chicks back inside. Chasing and rounding up 35 chicks is quite the workout. They are getting fast!
