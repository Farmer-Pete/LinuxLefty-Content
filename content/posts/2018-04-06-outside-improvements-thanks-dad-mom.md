Today my parents came over to help around the farm. My mom is really good at landscaping and helped us plant some plants out front and make the exterior a little nicer.

Dad got to work digging a trench. A while back, a new electrical cable had to be run to our well pump (long story). I've needed to bury the cable, and Dad was able to knock that out for me.

I'm so grateful to my parents who, even though they are grandparents, continue to demonstrate amazing work ethics! Thank you so much for your help :)
