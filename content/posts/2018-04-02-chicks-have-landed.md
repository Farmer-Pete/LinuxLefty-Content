## "Your Chicks Have Arrived"

As this was our first time having chicks, I was really worried. As soon as I got the tracking number, I was continuously checking, anxiously awaiting their arrival. Finally, this morning, I got the call:

> Peter Naudus? This is the Warrenton USPS post office. Your chicks have arrived, please come pick them up as soon as possible

I piled the two older kids in the car and off we went!

When we arrived at the post office, I could hear the chirping from the lobby. This is the first time that I've ever said, "Hi! I'm here to pick up my chicks." __Random quiz time:__ Did you know that you can also send {{<a "live bees and scorpions" "https://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/pub52c5_008.htm">}} through the mail?

And just like that, they handed over a box with a chirping commotion emanating from its contents.

I lifted the flap to peak inside and cute, tiny, fluffy chicks peered back at me.

## Moving Into Their New Home

We converted an old dog crate into their new home. I lined the sides with cardboard to protect the chicks from drafts and prevent debris (and chicks) from escaping.

Day one of this experiment is a success!
