We had quite the storm whip through here and it blew a number of our shingles off. Our roof started leaking, and I explained to my daughter that someone was going to come install a new roof. After hearing this, she exclaimed:

> Daddy! It will be so fun to see the sky and stars while we are inside!

I quickly realized that instead of simply replacing the shingles, she thought they were going to take off the ceiling as well! So funny :)
