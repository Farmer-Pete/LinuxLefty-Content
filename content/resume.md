I have almost two decades of professional experience as a enthusiastic, creative and tenacious programmer. I have both the technical skills coupled with the passion to solve problems and implement robust performant software. I am constantly striving, not only to improve myself, but to help those around me to do the same. I am currently a technical lead specializing in "big data" at Oracle.
