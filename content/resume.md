I have almost two decades of professional experience as an enthusiastic, creative, and tenacious programmer. I have both the technical skills coupled with the passion to solve problems and implement robust, performant software. I am constantly striving, not only to improve myself, but to help those around me to do the same. I am currently a technical lead specializing in "big data" at Oracle.

## Experience

### **Technical Lead** at **Oracle**

<p class="muted">February 2013 - Present</p>

In addition to maintaining all responsibilities prior to the acquisition, I created technical designs and assisted in the porting of the python-based system to Java. Eventually, I became the technical lead, where I implemented agile methodologies, coordinated tasks between multiple groups, and acted as an architect of many of the core systems. I maintained this leadership position as we rearchitected the system as a fleet of microservices running on top of Kubernetes and Docker. In addition to my development responsibilities, I also created and maintained the scripts which compiled, packaged, and versioned our releases.

At DataRaker, I was a key contributor to every portion of the development stack including: the encoding/decoding of the HTable rows/keys, data loading API, the distributed map/reduce framework, aggregation engines, DAL (data access layer), multiple in-memory and disk-based caching schemes, data filtering, metric computation, a graph-based calculation engine, javascript-based data visualizations, designed the HTML/CSS UI template. By the time Oracle acquired our company, I was the lead developer principally responsible for all code that comprised the back-end systems. I also acted as a DevOps engineer, developing an automated system to provision, install, and configure our Hadoop/HBase clusters.

I also contributed to other consulting projects, including a healthcare patient management system. I also redesigned the company website from scratch.
