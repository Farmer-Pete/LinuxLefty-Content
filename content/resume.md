I have almost two decades of professional experience as an enthusiastic, creative and tenacious programmer. I have both the technical skills coupled with the passion to solve problems and implement robust, performant software. I am constantly striving, not only to improve myself, but to help those around me to do the same. I am currently a technical lead specializing in "big data" at Oracle.

## Experience

### **Technical Lead** at **Oracle**

In addition to maintaining all responsibilities prior to the acquisition, I created technical designs and assisted in the porting of the python-based system to Java. Eventually, I became the technical lead, where I implemented agile methodologies, coordinated tasks between multiple groups, and acted as an architect of many of the core systems. I maintained this leadership position as we rearchitected the system as a fleet of microservices running on top of Kubernetes and Docker. In addition to my development responsibilities, I also created and maintained the scripts which compiled, packaged, and versioned our releases.
